## üìã Business Logic & Rules

### Transaction Approval Workflow
- **Amounts < 1,000**: Automatically approved and processed
- **Amounts ‚â• 1,000**: Require employee approval before processing
- **Smart Balance Management**: Separate usable balance calculation for pending transactions

### Balance Management System
- **Total Balance**: Includes all funds, including pending deposits
- **Usable Balance**: Available funds excluding pending withdrawals
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate balance updates for approved transactions

### Access Control Matrix
| Role | Capabilities |
|------|-------------|
| **Customer** | Create wallets, view own data, deposit/withdraw from own wallets |
| **Employee** | View all customer data, approve/deny transactions, administrative operations |

### Supported Operations
- **Deposit Sources**: IBAN (bank transfers), PAYMENT (payment systems)
- **Withdrawal Destinations**: IBAN (bank transfers), PAYMENT (payment systems)
- **Currency Support**: TRY, USD, EUR with proper validation
- **Wallet Settings**: Independent shopping and withdrawal activation flags

## üîÑ Concurrency & Thread Safety

The Digital Wallet Service implements robust concurrency control mechanisms to ensure data consistency and prevent race conditions in high-volume financial operations. This is critical for maintaining accurate balances and preventing double-spending scenarios.

### Core Concurrency Strategy

#### 1. Pessimistic Database Locking
The system uses **pessimistic write locks** to prevent concurrent modifications to wallet balances:

```java
@Lock(LockModeType.PESSIMISTIC_WRITE)
@Query("SELECT w FROM Wallet w WHERE w.id = :id")
Optional<Wallet> findByIdForUpdate(@Param("id") Long id);
```

**Key Benefits:**
- **Immediate Locking**: Locks wallet records at the database level during read
- **Race Condition Prevention**: Ensures only one transaction can modify a wallet at a time
- **Data Integrity**: Prevents lost updates and inconsistent balance calculations

#### 2. Transaction Isolation Levels
All financial operations use **READ_COMMITTED** isolation level:

```java
@Transactional(isolation = Isolation.READ_COMMITTED, rollbackFor = Exception.class)
public TransactionResponse deposit(DepositRequest request, Authentication authentication)
```

**Isolation Characteristics:**
- **Prevents Dirty Reads**: Transactions only see committed data
- **Allows Concurrent Reads**: Non-blocking read operations for better performance
- **Balanced Approach**: Optimal balance between consistency and performance


### Concurrency Testing & Validation

#### Comprehensive Test Coverage
The system includes dedicated concurrency tests that verify thread safety:

```java
@Test
void testConcurrentDeposits_withDistributedLocking() throws Exception {
    // Simulates 10 concurrent deposits to verify no race conditions
    int numberOfConcurrentDeposits = 10;
    BigDecimal depositAmount = new BigDecimal("10.00");
    // ... test implementation
}
```

**Test Scenarios:**
- **Concurrent Deposits**: Multiple simultaneous deposit operations
- **Concurrent Withdrawals**: Multiple withdrawal attempts with balance validation
- **Mixed Operations**: Combined deposits and withdrawals running simultaneously
- **Balance Verification**: Ensures final balances match expected calculations

#### Validation Results
‚úÖ **10 concurrent deposits**: All processed correctly, final balance accurate  
‚úÖ **5 concurrent withdrawals**: Proper balance deduction, no overdrafts  
‚úÖ **Mixed operations**: Combined deposits/withdrawals maintain consistency
