# ING Digital Wallet Service - API Testing Guide

A comprehensive guide for testing the Digital Wallet Service APIs with real-world scenarios and examples in LOCAL profile.

## üéØ Testing Overview

This guide provides practical examples for testing all API endpoints, including authentication, wallet management, and transaction processing. Each example includes expected responses and common error scenarios.

Below includes tests using bash interface. If you want to test using GUI, swagger-ui is available at address `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html` 

## üîê Authentication & Setup

### Step 1: Obtain JWT Token

#### Customer Login
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "customer1",
    "password": "password123"
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Login successful",
  "data": {
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJjdXN0b21lcjEi...",
    "id": 1,
    "username": "customer1",
    "role": "ROLE_CUSTOMER"
  }
}
```

#### Employee Login
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "employee1",
    "password": "password123"
  }'
```

### Step 2: Set Authentication Token
```bash
# Save the token for subsequent requests
export JWT_TOKEN="eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJjdXN0b21lcjEi..."

# Or for Windows PowerShell
$JWT_TOKEN = "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJjdXN0b21lcjEi..."
```

## üõ† Testing Tools & Tips

### Using Postman
1. **Import Environment**: Create environment variables for base_url and jwt_token
2. **Pre-request Scripts**: Automatically refresh JWT tokens
3. **Test Collections**: Group related API calls into collections
4. **Automated Testing**: Use Postman tests to validate responses

### Using Browser Developer Tools
1. **Network Tab**: Monitor actual API calls from frontend
2. **Console**: Test API calls directly with fetch() or axios
3. **Application Tab**: Inspect stored JWT tokens

### Command Line Testing
```bash
# Set base URL for easier testing
export BASE_URL="http://localhost:8080"

# Test API with pretty-printed JSON
curl -s "$BASE_URL/api/wallets" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN" | jq '.'

# Save response to file for analysis
curl -s "$BASE_URL/api/wallets" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN" > wallets_response.json
```

### PowerShell Testing (Windows)
```powershell
# Set variables
$baseUrl = "http://localhost:8080"
$headers = @{'Authorization' = "Bearer $jwtToken"; 'Content-Type' = 'application/json'}

# Test API call
$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "$baseUrl/api/wallets" -Headers $headers
$response | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10
```

## üìä Performance Testing

### Load Testing Example
```bash
# Simple load test with multiple concurrent requests
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/wallets \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN" &
done
wait

# Monitor response times
time curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/wallets \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN"
```

### Concurrent Transaction Testing
```bash
# Test concurrent deposits to same wallet
for i in {1..5}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/transactions/deposit \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"amount\":10,\"walletId\":1,\"source\":\"TR$i\",\"oppositePartyType\":\"IBAN\"}" &
done
wait
```
